# Calendar App

A simple calendar app I built with React. Still a work in progress but has the basics down.

## Features

- Monthly calendar view
- Navigate between months
- English/Japanese language support
- Responsive design

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- i18next for translations

## Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## What I Learned

This was a good exercise in:
- Working with dates in JavaScript (they're tricky!)
- Building reusable calendar components
- Handling month/year navigation
- i18n date formatting

## Future Plans

I want to add:
- Event creation and management
- Week view
- Export to iCal
- Recurring events
- Different calendar categories
